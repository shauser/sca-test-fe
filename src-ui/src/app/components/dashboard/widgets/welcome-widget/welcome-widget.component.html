    <p>Paperless is running! :)</p>
    <p>You can start uploading documents by dropping them in the file upload box to the right or by dropping them in the configured consumption folder and they'll start showing up in the documents list.
      After you've added some metadata to your documents, use the filtering mechanisms of paperless to create custom views (such as 'Recently added', 'Tagged TODO') and have them displayed on the dashboard instead of this message.</p>
    <p>Paperless offers some more features that try to make your life easier, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once you've got a couple documents in paperless and added metadata to them, paperless can assign that metadata to new documents automatically.</li>
      <li>You can configure paperless to read your mails and add documents from attached files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consult the documentation on how to use these features. The section on basic usage also has some information on how to use paperless in general.</p>
